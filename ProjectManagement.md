## <a name="breaking-down"></a>Breaking Down User Stories

* Capture goals along with acceptance criteria for each:

    * **Bad:** *Implement Angular Sign Up Loop*

    * **Good:** *As a user when I check out, I should be able to sign up*

    * **Best:** *As a user when I check out, I should receive a "Welcome Email", and a confirmation page after signup.*

* Break down stories to smaller chunks wherever needed

* Cards should have a single responsibility

* Use **Due Dates** to keep track of deadlines *(duh)*

* Only use **Checklists** for items that are associated, or 
  if you'd like to keep track of smaller tasks

    * If you have checklists with more than 2-3 items, most likely, the story could be broken down further

* Use labels to group cards together.  Standard labels include:
    * Feature
    * Bug

* Other common **Labels** include:
    * Customer
    * Blocking
    * Engineering
    * Design

* Use a single pull system.  Only have one ticket inprogress at any given time

* This is a list system that works for us
    * Copy & Creative
    * Backlog || Pipeline
    * Inprogress
    * Blocking
    * Ready for Testing
    * Delivered

* Prioritize cards from top to bottom (most important at the top)

* Maintain all conversations and attachments inside specific cards.
  Avoid emails & chatrooms at all costs.  Information will get lost.  *I guarantee it*

* When commenting, make sure to `@username` when appropriately

* Avoid assigning multiple **Team Members** to any one card
> Thins out responsibility and increases the chance of finger pointing.
